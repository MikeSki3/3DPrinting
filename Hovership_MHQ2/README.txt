# Summary

The redesigned 3D printed MHQ2 folding mini quadcopter frame has arrived! Building on the success of the original MHQ frame, we have improved the functionality, durability and stability of this frame. The MHQ2 uses the same arms and hardware from the MHQ with the addition of 4x more 18mm screws and 4x locknuts. The use of 6" props is possible with the new XL arms.

----  
   
KEY NEW FEATURES:  
----  
- Redesigned base with greatly reduced torsion for better flight stability.  
- Camera and battery have a lower center of gravity. Both now mount down on the flight control deck.  
- Hardtail mounting: you can skip the clean layer and mount the top plate directly to the base.  
- Wider landing gear and slots on the underside of the baseplate for mounting the battery if preferred.  
- Improved landing gear thickness and durability.  
- Mounting holes for SMA extension cables.  
- Integrated GoPro and Mobius mount. Reinforced structure reduces damage in a crash and elevates the GoPro for the use of a USB live-out FPV cable.  
- Support for M3 "bobbin" style vibration dampeners.  
- Now with 35mm spacers to support flight controllers with straight header pins.

UPDATES  
----  
* 12.01.2014 - Added V2 of rugged arm. Added short version of clean-lower: this is 6mm shorter and should fit better on 200x200mm print beds (placed diagonally).

# Instructions

Print Settings  
===  
* 200x200mm minimum print bed is required. The largest part should fit when rotated 45 degrees and printed diagonally on the bed.  
* Arms and landing gear: 75% infill or more, 2-3 walls  
* Plates: 40% Infill, 2-3 walls

Required Hardware  
====  
   
**Motors:**  
--  
* 16x 6mm M2 or M3 bolts - depending on which motors you use   
   
**Arms:**   
---  
* 4x 18mm M3 bolts   
* 4x 20mm M3 bolts   
* 8x M3 nylon washers   
* 8x M3 thin metal washers   
* 8x M3 lock nuts   
   
**Base**  
---  
* 4x 18mm M3 bolts   
* 4x M3 lock nuts   
   
**Landing gear:**  
---  
* 4x 18mm M3 bolts   
* 4x M3 lock nuts   
   
**Standoffs (to separate the upper decks):**   
---  
* The two deck plates that are separated with these standoffs have holes for 8 but I found that 6 was enough, 3 in opposing corners.   
* 35mm M3 female threaded spacers  
* 12x 5mm M3 bolts   
   
**Vibration dampeners:**  
---  
* ATG small grey (7mm hole mounting): http://www.goodluckbuy.com/4-pcs-atg-anti-vibration-sphere-av-ball-high-elastic-rubber-ball-dual-head-anti-vibration-for-ptz-small.html or http://www.aliexpress.com/item/ATG-AV-Ball-High-Elastic-Rubber-Ball-Dual-head-Anti-vibration-for-PTZ-Small-Grey-color/1023411887.html   
* Or any 4x M3 "bobbin" style vibration dampener: http://shop.hovership.com/m3-rubber-vibration-bobbins/
