# Summary

I designed this Ukulele after printing a few of the other Ukes on Thingiverse that were good but still had room for improvement.  
Improvements include:  
No buzzing  
No sharp corners  
Doesn't get out of tune on the higher frets.  
2 halves fit together properly  
machines fit great.  

The 2 parts fit together snugly for me there was no need for glue but depending on your printer/slicer you may need to.  
You will need 4 Uke machine heads just google B00EQ29KNG and you'll find the ones I used.  I bought some machine heads that were too long so I made a spacer block you can add to the back so everything will still work properly.  
also you will need 4 Ukelele strings.  
You will need a print area at least 10.5" tall.  
If you want to print this on a smaller printer let me know what size you have and I can try to split it up for you so you can glue the parts together.  
I've improved everything I could think of but if you feel like there is something that could be better please let me know!  
All feedback is welcome.  

02/21/2015 - Added new files with neck and body cut in half for a smaller height requirement (now 5.35" or 136 mm tall)  I haven't tried gluing these halves together so let me know how that works for you.  

02/28/2015 - Added a spacer that you can add to the back of the head if your tuners are too long.
