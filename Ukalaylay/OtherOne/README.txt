# Summary

Full-size Soprano Ukulele which prints with no supports.  
  
  
Now includes files for both smaller and larger printers.    
  
  
  
Designed to work with standard guitar or ukulele tuning machines and standard ukulele strings.  Playable and is full soprano scale.  
  
  
  
Many iterations to get to this design including: curved body for strength and to resist warping and Inner bracing which generally prevents delamination.  
  
  
  
I have been playing my first print for about 6 months without issue.  
  
  
  
  
UPDATE:  Now includes files for smaller printers.  Body lower and upper and Neck lower and upper.  I included tabs on the body and neck to try and make glueing up the pieces easier.  Let me know if any issues.

# Instructions

Body  
  
Use at least 4 layers and 50% fill.  This will ensure that you have sufficient stiffness in the body and structure supports to hold the string tension.  Printing from the inside out general works best for the initial overhang which is the roughest part of the print.   
  
  
Neck   
  
Like the body use lots of layers on the outside (at least 4).  For the neck I have had success with 50% fill, but wouldn't do any less to ensure you have sufficient strength for strings.  
  
  
Now includes files for small printers.  Upper and Lower Body and Upper and Lower neck.  Super glue the parts all together once printed.
